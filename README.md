  # Compiler Design

</div>

## Introduction

This repository contains my analysis of the inner workings of a compiler. A compiler is a crucial component of modern software development, responsible for translating high-level programming languages into machine code that can be executed by a computer's CPU. Understanding how a compiler functions is essential for both software developers and computer scientists.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of this analysis is to provide a comprehensive overview of the key components and processes involved in compiler design and operation. It aims to shed light on the following aspects:

1. **Lexical Analysis**: Exploring how a compiler breaks down the source code into tokens and identifies the language's keywords and symbols.

2. **Syntax Analysis**: Examining the process of constructing an abstract syntax tree (AST) to represent the program's structure and relationships between elements.

3. **Semantic Analysis**: Discussing how compilers perform type checking, symbol resolution, and other crucial checks to ensure code correctness.

5. **Optimization**: Investigating various optimization techniques employed by compilers to improve code performance and efficiency.

6. **Code Generation**: Explaining how compilers convert intermediate code into machine-specific assembly language or binary code.

### Phases of a Compiler

There are two major phases of compilation, which in turn have many parts. Each of them takes input from the output of the previous level and works in a coordinated way.
